## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

- **Source**: IBM HR Analytics dataset (or custom HR dataset)
- **Features**: Age, BusinessTravel, Department, DistanceFromHome, JobRole, MonthlyIncome, OverTime, etc.
- **Target**: `Attrition` (Yes or No)

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest âœ… *(Best performing model)*
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy.

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix

> Note: Further evaluation using F1-score, precision, and recall is recommended for better insight into model performance on imbalanced data.
